            <h3>What are exoplanets? </h3>
            <p> Exoplanets are planets outside our Solar System. Some orbit other stars but there are free-floating exoplanets that do not. Instead, they 
                orbit the galatic center and are called rogue planets.  </p>
            <p> 
                Fun Facts: Discovered by NASA's Keplre Space Telescope: we know now that there are more planets than stars in the galaxy.
            </p>
            <p>
                The majority of discovered exoplanets are in the Milky Way Galaxy. We can find exoplanets by measuring their size and mass. Additionally, we 
                can discover their composition whether the planet is really rocky (like Earth) or very gaseous (like Jupiter). Although they are similar in composition to 
                our own planets, the combination of basic elements are different. For example, some planets could be filled with water or ice but others could be 
                predominantly made of iron or carbon. When looking for exoplanets, we want to look for specific types that could potentially host life or have signs of previous life. Typically, the planet is the 
                same size as Earth and it orbits a start in the <b>"habitable zone"</b>
            </p>
            <h3>The Habitable Zone</h3>
            <p> 
                The habitable zone (commonly nicknamed the "Goldilocks Zone") is a range of distances from a star where liquid water could be possible - something 
                extremely vital for life on Earth. With recent calculations and discoveries, the habitable zone includes other factors such as thermal equilibrium and
                 the greenhouse effect.
