            <h2> What are exoplanets? </h2>
            <p> Exoplanets are planets outside our Solar System. Some orbit other stars but there are free-floating exoplanets that do not. Instead, they 
                orbit the galatic cccenter and are called rogue planets.  </p>
            <p> 
                Did you know that there are more planets than stars in the galaxy? This was discovered by NASA's Kepler Space Telescope.
            </p>
            <p>
                The majority of discovered exoplanets are in the Milky Way Galaxy. We can find exoplanets by measuring their size and mass. Additionally, we 
                can discover their composition whether the planet is really rocky (like Earth) or very gaseous (like Jupiter). Although they are similar in composition to 
                our own planets, the combination of basic elements are different. For example, some planets could be filled with water or ice but others could be 
                predominantly made of iron or carbon.
