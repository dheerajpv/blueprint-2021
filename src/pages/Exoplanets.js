            <h3>What are exoplanets? </h3>
            <p> Exoplanets are planets outside our Solar System. Some orbit other stars but there are free-floating exoplanets that do not. Instead, they 
                orbit the galatic center and are called rogue planets.  </p>
            <p> 
                Fun Facts: Discovered by NASA's Keplre Space Telescope: we know now that there are more planets than stars in the galaxy.
            </p>
            <p>
                The majority of discovered exoplanets are in the Milky Way Galaxy. We can find exoplanets by measuring their size and mass. Additionally, we 
                can discover their composition whether the planet is really rocky (like Earth) or very gaseous (like Jupiter). Although they are similar in composition to 
                our own planets, the combination of basic elements are different. For example, some planets could be filled with water or ice but others could be 
                predominantly made of iron or carbon. When looking for exoplanets, we want to look for specific types that could potentially host life or have signs of previous life. Typically, the planet is the 
                same size as Earth and it orbits a start in the <b>"habitable zone"</b>
            </p>
            <h3>The Habitable Zone</h3>
            <p> 
                The habitable zone (commonly nicknamed the "Goldilocks Zone") is a range of distances from a star where liquid water could be possible - something 
                extremely vital for life on Earth. With recent calculations and discoveries, the habitable zone includes other factors such as thermal equilibrium and
                 the greenhouse effect.

            <h3>Astrobiology</h3>
            <p>
                Are we alone? I think that is the biggest unanswered question to this day. I remember when I was first asked this question, I immediately said yes. It was a 
                naive answer at the time but I couldn't wrap my head around the possibility that there could be life outside our planet. As I entered my own wormhole of YouTube
                and papers, I learned about exoplanets and astrobiology. With all the fun facts above, the odds of not finding life is extremly small. Why haven't we found 
                anything? Let's bring in the Fermi Paradox, created by Italian physicist, Enrico Fermi, who wondered this as well. There are many reasons and interesting 
                theories to the Fermi Paradox but I wanted to share a few of my favorites.

                    <li>The Great Filter is a benchmark in our cosmological timeline that is a test of survival, intelligence, and/or society. That's a little broad but 
                        in most theories about the Great Filter there is a general consensus of the timeline.
